= Releasing

Note that this is now automated via https://github.com/vpro/jcr-criteria/actions/workflows/release.yml[github actions].

Basically this is how it goes:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -Pdeploy release:prepare release:perform -B
----

Snapshots are deployed to sonatype.

releases can be put quicker to nexus.vpro.nl like this:
[source, bash]
----
git checkout 2.8
mvn -DaltDeploymentRepository=nexusvpro::http://nexus.vpro.nl/content/repositories/releases  deploy
----
